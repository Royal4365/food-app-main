# Setting Up Environment Variables in Vercel

## Overview

This guide will help you properly configure environment variables in Vercel to fix the database connection issues with your restaurant and menu pages.

## Required Environment Variables

Based on your application, you need to set up the following environment variables in Vercel:

### 1. Database Connection

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require"
```

Replace with your actual PostgreSQL database connection string.

### 2. Authentication Keys

Use the keys generated by the `generate-vercel-keys.js` script:

```
JWT_SECRET="1e39c3aa2ae1ff031d4ef3250eb89fea8052a6b80a048ba0a16cfd40947b28cb"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="a14223483baabc9d57c3d7e886bebaa66b3c5da1582da3b9b8692ffd64fbb6d1"
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-app-name.vercel.app"  # Replace with your actual Vercel URL
```

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Access Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your food app project

### 2. Navigate to Environment Variables

1. Click on the "Settings" tab
2. Scroll down to the "Environment Variables" section

### 3. Add Environment Variables

1. Add each variable one by one:
   - Enter the name (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`)
   - Enter the value (your connection string)
   - Select environments (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click "Add"
2. Repeat for all required variables

### 4. Verify Environment Variables

1. After adding all variables, review them to ensure they're correct
2. Make sure there are no typos or missing variables

### 5. Redeploy Your Application

1. Go to the "Deployments" tab
2. Click on "Redeploy" for your latest deployment
3. This will apply the new environment variables

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues after setting up the environment variables:

1. Check the Vercel deployment logs for any errors
2. Verify your database connection string is correct
3. Ensure your database allows connections from Vercel's IP addresses
4. Run the `test-db-connection.js` script locally to test your connection

## Database Connection String Format

Make sure your `DATABASE_URL` follows this format:

```
postgresql://username:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require
```

For example, if you're using NeonDB, it might look like:

```
postgresql://user:pass@ep-cool-name-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```

## Next Steps

After setting up your environment variables and redeploying:

1. Visit your deployed application
2. Test the restaurant and menu pages
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. If issues persist, refer to the `VERCEL_DATABASE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` file for more advanced troubleshooting steps
