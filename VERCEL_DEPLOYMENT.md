# Deploying to Vercel

This guide will help you deploy your Food App to Vercel.

## Prerequisites

1. A [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account
2. A PostgreSQL database (we recommend [Neon](https://neon.tech) for serverless PostgreSQL)
3. Your project code pushed to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Database

Ensure you have a PostgreSQL database ready for production use. Copy your database connection string as you'll need it for the environment variables.

### 2. Connect Your Repository to Vercel

1. Log in to your Vercel account
2. Click "Add New" â†’ "Project"
3. Import your Git repository
4. Select the repository containing your Food App

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables in the Vercel project settings:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Your production URL (e.g., https://your-app.vercel.app)
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: A secure random string for NextAuth.js
- `JWT_SECRET`: A secure random string for JWT authentication

You can generate secure random strings using this command:
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

### 4. Deploy Your Application

1. Click "Deploy" in the Vercel dashboard
2. Wait for the build and deployment to complete
3. Once deployed, Vercel will provide you with a URL to access your application

### 5. Verify Deployment

1. Visit your deployed application URL
2. Test key functionality to ensure everything works as expected
3. Check that authentication, restaurant listings, and menu items are working correctly

## Handling Large Files and node_modules

When deploying to Vercel, you might encounter issues with large files or the node_modules directory:

1. **node_modules**: This directory is automatically excluded during deployment. Vercel will install dependencies based on your package.json file.

2. **File Size Limits**: Vercel has a 100MB limit for files. If you're trying to upload large files, consider:
   - Using a CDN for large assets
   - Storing files in a separate storage service
   - Breaking down large files into smaller chunks

3. **.vercelignore**: A .vercelignore file has been added to your project to explicitly exclude node_modules and other unnecessary files during deployment.

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

If you encounter database connection problems:

1. Verify your `DATABASE_URL` is correct
2. Ensure your database allows connections from Vercel's IP addresses
3. Check that SSL settings are properly configured

### Build Failures

If your build fails:

1. Check the build logs in Vercel
2. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed
3. Verify that your code works locally with `npm run build`

## Continuous Deployment

Vercel automatically deploys your application when you push changes to your repository. To disable this behavior, you can configure deployment settings in the Vercel dashboard.

## Custom Domains

To use a custom domain:

1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
2. Navigate to the "Domains" section
3. Add your custom domain and follow the verification steps
